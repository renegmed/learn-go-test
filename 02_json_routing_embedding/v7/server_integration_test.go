* We are creating our two components we are trying to integrate
with: InMemoryPlayerStore and PlayerServer.

* We then fire off 3 requests to record 3 wins for player. We're
not too concerned about the status codes in this test as it's
not relevant to whether they are integrating well.

* The next response we do care about (so we store a variable response)
because we are going to try and get the player's score.
